# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Sync Music Player is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that enables users to create and join music rooms where they can listen to music together in real-time synchronization. The application uses Firebase Authentication for user management and Firebase Realtime Database for synchronizing music playback across multiple users. The app features a mobile-first, responsive design using Material UI and provides seamless audio synchronization capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign in using Google or email/password authentication, so that I can access the music player application securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL display authentication options for Google sign-in and email/password sign-in
2. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL store their user information (displayName, photoURL, email) in the Firebase Realtime Database users node
3. WHEN an unauthenticated user attempts to access the main application THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the authentication page
4. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL display their avatar and name in the top navigation bar
5. WHEN a user signs out THEN the system SHALL clear their session and redirect them to the authentication page

### Requirement 2: Room Creation

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to create a music room with configurable settings, so that I can invite friends to listen to music together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user clicks "Create Room" THEN the system SHALL display a room creation form
2. WHEN creating a room THEN the system SHALL allow the user to set the maximum number of participants (default 2, configurable)
3. WHEN a room is created THEN the system SHALL generate a unique roomId and store room data with creatorId, maxMembers, members list, and initial state
4. WHEN a room is created THEN the system SHALL provide a join code or shareable link (/room/:roomId) for inviting others
5. WHEN a room is created THEN the system SHALL automatically add the creator to the room's member list
6. WHEN a room is created THEN the system SHALL redirect the creator to the room interface

### Requirement 3: Room Joining

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to join existing music rooms using a room code or link, so that I can participate in synchronized music listening.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Join Room" THEN the system SHALL display an input field for entering a room code or allow direct navigation via room link
2. WHEN a user attempts to join a room THEN the system SHALL verify the room exists and is not at maximum capacity
3. WHEN a room is at maximum capacity THEN the system SHALL display a friendly message blocking new joins
4. WHEN a user successfully joins a room THEN the system SHALL add their userId to the room's members list
5. WHEN a user joins a room THEN the system SHALL display real-time member count to all participants
6. WHEN a user is already in a room THEN the system SHALL prevent them from joining another room simultaneously

### Requirement 4: Music Synchronization

**User Story:** As a room participant, I want music playback to be synchronized across all users in real-time, so that everyone hears the same audio at the same time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN music playback state changes (play/pause/seek) THEN the system SHALL update the room state in Firebase Realtime Database with isPlaying, currentTime, and timestamp
2. WHEN room state changes THEN the system SHALL synchronize all participants' audio players to match the new state
3. WHEN a user joins a room with active playback THEN the system SHALL sync their player to the current song position
4. WHEN the audio element loads THEN the system SHALL start muted for autoplay compliance
5. WHEN a user interacts with the player THEN the system SHALL unmute the audio
6. WHEN synchronization occurs THEN the system SHALL account for network latency using timestamps

### Requirement 5: Music Player Interface

**User Story:** As a room participant, I want an intuitive music player interface with standard controls, so that I can interact with the synchronized playback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying the music player THEN the system SHALL show album art, song title, artist name in a card-based interface
2. WHEN displaying player controls THEN the system SHALL provide play/pause, next/previous, and mute buttons
3. WHEN displaying progress THEN the system SHALL show a seekable progress bar indicating current playback position
4. WHEN a user seeks to a different position THEN the system SHALL update the synchronized playback for all participants
5. WHEN player state changes THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions and visual feedback

### Requirement 6: Room Management

**User Story:** As a room creator, I want administrative controls over my room, so that I can manage participants and room settings effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is the room creator THEN the system SHALL provide options to kick users, change maxMembers, and end the room
2. WHEN a creator kicks a user THEN the system SHALL remove them from the room and notify them appropriately
3. WHEN a creator ends a room THEN the system SHALL remove all participants and delete the room data
4. WHEN any user leaves a room THEN the system SHALL remove them from the members list
5. WHEN the last user leaves a room THEN the system SHALL automatically delete the room from the database

### Requirement 7: Progressive Web App Features

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the application to work as a Progressive Web App, so that I can install it on my device and use it offline when possible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL include a valid manifest.json file with app metadata and icons
2. WHEN the application is accessed THEN the system SHALL register a service worker for offline functionality
3. WHEN the device supports PWA installation THEN the system SHALL make the app installable on mobile devices
4. WHEN offline THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate offline page through the service worker
5. WHEN online THEN the system SHALL cache essential resources for improved performance

### Requirement 8: Responsive Design

**User Story:** As a user on various devices, I want the application to work seamlessly across different screen sizes, so that I can use it on mobile, tablet, or desktop.
